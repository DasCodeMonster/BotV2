# BotV2
## Info
This is a Discord-Bot mainly for playing music. This Bot is built with [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) (see also [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) and [docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome))  
**Not everything will work at the moment. This bot is in an early state of development**

## Installing
1. Dowload or clone the repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/DasCodeMonster/BotV2.git
```
2. Open the "Token&Keys.json" file within an editor and fill in you credentials between the double quotes.
To get a bot token you need to crate an [application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create) on [Discord](https://discordapp.com).
If you need some Help creating your application, getting a token or adding your bot to your server look [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
3. Run following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install everything you need to start the bot.
After this you can run `npm start` to start the bot.
The bot should come online now.
Have fun!

If you find any bugs or having errors just open an Issue.    
**Note:** Be aware of the fact that the way things are stored can change at any time and your current Settings will be usless and might also crash the bot. So if you have trouble after updating the bot, first try deleting the databases and start the bot again.

## About me
Hi I am a student from Germany and this is my first "big" project and my first JavaScript project at all.
Feel free to clone my repo and test the bot. I am happy about every feedback.
